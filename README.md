# Testing Practice
A project for The Odin Project's Javascript Course, where we have to build several tests, and then make the tests pass.  
Below are the assignments of the projects:  
Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!  
1. A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
2. A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
4. A caesarCipher function that takes a string and returns it with each character “shifted”.
- Don’t forget to test wrapping from z to a.
- Don’t forget to test keeping the same case.
- Don’t forget to test punctuation!
5. An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
